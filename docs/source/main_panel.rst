Getting Started with ATA
-----------------------

The Advanced Texture Assign Tool makes it easy to assign the right textures to your materials automatically. Here's how to get started in just a few minutes:

1. **Open the Tool**: Go to Tools > Advanced Texture Assign Tool > Window
2. **Add Materials**: Click "Get Materials" to add materials from selected objects, or drag materials directly into the tool
3. **Select Texture Folder**: Click the folder icon and select the folder containing your textures
4. **Assign Textures**: Click "Assign Textures" to automatically process and assign textures

That's it! ATA will analyze your texture files, determine their types based on naming conventions, and assign them to the appropriate properties on your materials.
